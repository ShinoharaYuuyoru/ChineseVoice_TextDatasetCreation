Graduation Project README.

This project aims to set up a dataset to next Audio Processing step.

The target is that we want to get many *.mp3 files which are named by the subtitle that said in the audio.

Here are the steps:
	1. Seperate and convert audio files of *.mkv, *.mp4 video files to *.mp3 files by *.bat.
	2. Convert *.ass subtitle files to *.srt files.
	3. Convert *.srt files to files which are full of FFmpeg seperating commands.
	4. Execute *.bat to finish seperating.
